# 🟦 Base is for... Your Word Here! 🔥

Define Base in your own words — literally.

**"Base is for..."** is a sleek and minimal tool for crafting onchain word-based NFTs that let you define what **Base** means to *you* — one word at a time.

## ✨ What is this?

This is a creative minting experience built on the [Base](https://base.org) network. You pick **a single word** that represents your vision, vibe, or identity — and mint it as an NFT.

- Want to say *"Base is for Builders"*?
- Or maybe *"Base is for Love"*?
- Perhaps *"Base is for ME"*?

You got it. Just type. Mint. Done.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔁 **Infinite Minting**  
  Any word can be minted by anyone — infinitely. This is about expressing, not owning.

- 🖋️ **Signed & Timestamped**  
  Each NFT is signed by your wallet and contains the exact time of mint — a forever-mark on the Base chain.

- 🧱 **Fully Onchain Metadata**  
  Everything lives on the chain — no external dependencies. Your word is forever.
